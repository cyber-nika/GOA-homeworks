<p>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. The club compete in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club have traditionally worn a white home kit. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was given by King Alfonso XIII in 1920, as well as the crown being added to the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European football clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. Its anthem is the "Hala Madrid y nada más".

    Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and the best European club of the same era by the IFFHS. In 2004, they were awarded the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit. Real Madrid, along with Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, is one of the three La Liga clubs that has never been relegated since the league's start in 1929. The club has notable rivalries, particularly the El Clásico with Barcelona and the Madrid derby with Atlético Madrid. In the 1950s and 60s, Real Madrid became a powerhouse in Spanish and European football, winning five consecutive and a total of six European Cups, as well as 12 league titles in 16 years. This legendary team, featuring players like Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, and Paco Gento, is widely lauded. Real Madrid is famous for its "Galácticos" policy, where they sign top global stars like Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, and David Beckham, particularly during Florentino Pérez's presidency. In 2009, they signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record £80 million, who went on to become the club’s and football’s all-time top scorer.More recently, the club has shifted its focus to signing and improving young talents like Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, and Jude Bellingham.
    
    In domestic football, Real Madrid has won 71 trophies, including a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey titles, and 13 Supercopa de España titles. Internationally, the club has claimed a record 34 trophies: a record 15 UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record eight FIFA Club World Cup titles. The club has the most participations in the European Cup/Champions League and holds records for the most wins and goals scored. They are the only team to win three consecutive Champions League titles, in both the 1950s and 2010s. In June 2024, they won their 15th Champions League title, extending their record, and became the first European club to win 100 trophies across all competitions. Real Madrid was ranked first in the IFFHS Club World Ranking in 2000, 2002, 2014, and 2017 and currently tops UEFA’s all-time club rankings. As of July 2024, Real Madrid ranks second in the UEFA club rankings and first for the past decade.
    
    Real Madrid is one of the most widely supported football clubs globally and the most followed on social media. In 2024, the club was valued at $6.6 billion, making it the world’s most valuable football club. That same year, Madrid became the first football club to generate €1 billion ($1.1 billion) in revenue.
    
    History</p>
<h1>Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>

<p> </p>

<p> is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, most appearances (30), assists (8), goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (133) and international appearances (215). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 900 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.[note 4]

    Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player, and the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.
    
    Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has earned more than 200 caps, making him history's most-capped male player.[11] With 130 international goals, he is also the all-time top male goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in eleven major tournaments and scored in ten; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. The same tournament, he broke the record of most international goals scored in men's football and became the player with the most international caps in men's football in 2023.
    
    One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. Ronaldo is the most popular sportsperson on social media: he counts over 1 billion total followers across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, making him the first person to achieve that feat. In 2020, Ronaldo was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and he is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.</p>

    <p>Alfredo Stéfano Di Stéfano Laulhé was a professional footballer and coach who played as a forward, regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. Nicknamed "Saeta Rubia" ("Blond Arrow"), he is best known for his achievements with Real Madrid, where he was instrumental in the club's domination of the European Cup and La Liga during the 1950s and 1960s. Along with Francisco Gento and José María Zárraga, he was one of only three players to play a part in all five European Cup victories, scoring goals in each of the five finals. Di Stéfano played international football mostly for Spain after moving to Madrid, but he also played for Argentina and Colombia.

        Di Stéfano began his career at Argentina's River Plate aged 17, in 1943. For the 1946 season he was loaned to Club Atlético Huracán, but he returned to River in 1947. Due to a footballers' strike in Argentina in 1949, Di Stéfano went to play for Millonarios of Bogotá in the Colombian league. He won six league titles during the first 12 years of his career in Argentina and Colombia.[9][10] Following his signing by Real Madrid he was an integral part of one of the most successful teams of all time. He scored 216 league goals in 282 games for Real (then a club record, since surpassed by Raúl, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema), striking up a successful partnership with Ferenc Puskás. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was the all-time highest tally in the European Cup. The record has since been surpassed by several players, including the aforementioned Real Madrid trio. Di Stéfano scored in five consecutive European Cup finals for Real Madrid between 1956 and 1960, including a hat-trick in the last. Perhaps, the highlight of his time with the club was their 7–3 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 final at Hampden Park, a game many consider to be the finest exhibition of club football ever witnessed in Europe.[8] He moved to Espanyol in 1964 and played there until retiring at the age of 40.
        
        Di Stéfano was awarded the Ballon d'Or for the European Footballer of the Year in 1957 and 1959. He is currently the seventh highest scorer in the history of Spain's top division, and Real Madrid's fourth highest league goalscorer of all time. He is Madrid's leading goalscorer in the history of El Clásico, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Spain by the Royal Spanish Football Federation as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. He was voted fourth, behind Pelé, Diego Maradona, and Johan Cruyff, in a vote organized by France Football magazine which consulted their former Ballon d'Or winners to elect the Football Player of the Century. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players (in September 2009, he said Di Stéfano was the best player "ever"). In 2008 Di Stéfano was honoured by both UEFA and Real Madrid with a special Presidents' award issued by FIFA at a ceremony in Madrid, where a statue was also unveiled. Then UEFA President Michel Platini called Di Stéfano "a great amongst the greats" while contemporaries Eusébio and Just Fontaine suggested that he was "the most complete footballer in the history of the game"</p>
